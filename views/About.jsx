			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is the about section of the project. In this section we, the team, can and will tell you about this project and its history. You see, in the beginning, in the vast emptiness of nothingness, there existed a tiny, unimaginably dense point. We call it the Singularity. It harbored within itself all the energy, matter, and potential for the universe yet to be born.</p>

			<p>And then, with a cosmic sigh, it happened—the Big Bang. The Singularity exploded, and the universe burst forth like a celestial firework. Space itself expanded, stretching and unfolding, creating the canvas upon which galaxies would later paint their stories.</p>

			<p>In the early moments, the universe was a seething cauldron of energy. Particles danced, collided, and merged. Quarks and gluons waltzed together, forging protons and neutrons. Photons, those ethereal messengers of light, sprang forth, illuminating the cosmic stage.</p>

			<p>As the universe cooled, gravity stepped in. It whispered to the particles, urging them to gather. And so, in the vast cosmic darkness, the first stars ignited. These stellar pioneers—massive, luminous, and hungry for fusion—wove tales of hydrogen and helium.</p>

			<p>Galaxies emerged, like cosmic cities, each with its spiral arms, globular clusters, and supermassive black holes at the center. The Milky Way, our home, spun its galactic dance, and we became stardust spectators.</p>

			<p>Stars lived, loved, and died. Some exploded in fiery supernovae, scattering heavy elements—carbon, oxygen, gold—across the cosmos. These elements swirled, collided, and coalesced into new stars, planets, and moons.</p>

			<p>But wait! Not all was as it seemed. Dark matter, that elusive enigma, held galaxies in its invisible embrace. It didn't shine, but its gravitational pull shaped the cosmic ballet. And then there was dark energy, pushing the universe apart, like a cosmic breath.</p>

			<p>On a tiny blue planet called Earth, life stirred. Microbes danced in primordial oceans, and evolution composed its grand symphony. Creatures crawled, swam, and took flight. Humans emerged, gazing at the stars with wonder.</p>

			<p>Beyond Earth's atmosphere, the cosmic web stretched—a delicate lacework of galaxies, filaments, and voids. And in this vast expanse, we wondered: Are we alone? Is there another stardust storyteller out there, singing its own cosmic ballad?</p>

			<p>And so, dear reader, the universe continues its epic saga. Stars are born, galaxies collide, and black holes whisper secrets. We, mere stardust beings, play our part, writing our chapters in the cosmic library.</p>

			<p>As we gaze at the night sky, remember that we are made of starstuff—the remnants of ancient explosions, the echoes of cosmic dreams. And perhaps, just perhaps, the universe itself is a story, waiting for us to turn the next page.</p>

			<p>And so, the cosmic odyssey unfolds, across eons and parsecs, weaving wonder and mystery. The universe whispers, "Come, explore. There are more stories to tell."</p>

			<p>And so, we look up, our eyes alight with curiosity, and venture forth into the cosmic unknown.</p>

			<p>Then some time passed and we did this project.</p>

			<p>The End.</p>
